What is an Exception?
 
In Java, an exception is an unexpected event that disrupts the normal flow of a program.

Exception HIerarchy : 

Object
  └── Throwable
       ├── Error
       │     └── OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError
       └── Exception
             ├── Checked Exceptions (IOException, SQLException)
             └── Unchecked Exceptions (RuntimeException, NullPointerException, ArithmeticException)

Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions
 
Checked: Java forces you to handle them at compile time.
Example: Reading from a file → File might not exist.

Unchecked: Occur at runtime; no compiler warning.
Example: Dividing by zero.
